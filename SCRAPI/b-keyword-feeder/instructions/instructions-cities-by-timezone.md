#### üì¶ Keyword Feeder Integration

- Updated `keyword-feeder.js`:
  - CLI usage: `node data/keyword-feeder.js <batch_id> "<keyword>"`
  - Supports `city` and `CITY` placeholders
  - Outputs directly to `data/master-queries.json`
- Uses `batch_id` to pull matching cities from `location_data`
- Supports up to 100k rows with `.range(0, 99999)`

Let me know if you'd like to:
- Create a permanent `batch_lookup` table
- Automate keyword creation across all batches
- Auto-run `npm run scrapi` post-feed
- Visualize batches in a dashboard

üî• You're now batch-ready, zip-code-sniper precise, and primed for full-funnel automation.
