## 🚀 **FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS**

### **Working Entry Points:**
1. **Single Query Processing** ✅
   ```bash
   node SCRAPI/entry-points/single-query/scrapi-automation.cjs "query" "location"
   ```

2. **Batch Processing** ✅
   ```bash
   # Legacy compatible
   node SCRAPI/entry-points/batch-processing/scrapi-batch-automation.cjs
   
   # Modern processor
   node SCRAPI/job-management/processors/batch-processor.cjs
   ```

3. **Real-time Monitoring** ✅
   ```bash
   # Live dashboard
   node SCRAPI/job-management/tracking/batch-status-dashboard.cjs live
   
   # Job tracking
   node SCRAPI/job-management/tracking/batch-tracker.cjs dashboard
   ```

4. **CLI Interface** ✅
   ```bash
   node SCRAPI/cli/main-cli.cjs
   ```

### **Core Systems:**
- ✅ **Configuration Validation** - Supabase & Oxylabs credentials
- ✅ **Centralized Logging** - File-based logging with timestamps
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Retry logic and comprehensive error management
- ✅ **Job Queue Management** - Submitted → In-Progress → Completed tracking
- ✅ **Real-time Dashboards** - Multiple visualization options
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility** - All legacy commands still work

## 📈 **CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS**
